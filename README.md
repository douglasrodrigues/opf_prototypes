## Structure

 * `data`: Folder containing the OPF file format datasets;
 * `models`
   * `heuristics.py`: Defines the possible meta-heuristics that can be used;
 * `utils`
   * `datasetinfo.py`: Stores pertinent information from the dataset;
   * `optimizer.py`: Wraps the optimization task into a single method;
   * `outputter.py`: Converts the optimization history into readable output files;
   * `targets.py`: Implements the objective functions to be optimized.

## Package Guidelines

### Installation

Install all the pre-needed requirements using:

```Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install Optimum-Path Forest library as following:

```
git clone https://github.com/jppbsi/libopf
cd LibOPF
make
gcc -Wl,-soname,OPF -o OPF.so -shared -fPIC src/OPF.c src/util/common.c src/util/gqueue.c src/util/realheap.c src/util/set.c src/util/sgctree.c src/util/subgraph.c -I include/ -I include/util/
```

go to your home directory, open .bashrc (Linux) or .bash_profile (OSX) and add the following line:

```
export OPF_DIR=<path where LibOPF has been installed>
```


## Usage

### Prototypes Optimization

```Python
python prototypes.py -h
```

*Note that `-h` invokes the script helper, which assists users in employing the appropriate parameters.*

### Bash Script

Instead of invoking every script to conduct the experiments, it is also possible to use the provided shell scripts, as follows:

```Bash
./pipeline.sh
```

Such a script will conduct every step needed to accomplish the experimentation used throughout this paper. Furthermore, one can change any input argument that is defined in the script.
