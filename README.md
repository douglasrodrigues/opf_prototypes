## Structure

 * `data`: Folder containing the OPF file format datasets;
 * `models`
   * `heuristics.py`: Defines the possible meta-heuristics that can be used;
 * `utils`
   * `datasetinfo.py`: Stores pertinent information from the dataset;
   * `optimizer.py`: Wraps the optimization task into a single method;
   * `outputter.py`: Converts the optimization history into readable output files;
   * `targets.py`: Implements the objective functions to be optimized.

## Package Guidelines

### Installation

Install all the pre-needed requirements using:

```Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Prototypes Optimization

```Python
python prototypes.py -h
```

*Note that `-h` invokes the script helper, which assists users in employing the appropriate parameters.*

### Bash Script

Instead of invoking every script to conduct the experiments, it is also possible to use the provided shell scripts, as follows:

```Bash
./pipeline.sh
```

Such a script will conduct every step needed to accomplish the experimentation used throughout this paper. Furthermore, one can change any input argument that is defined in the script.
